# Prodev Mobile App Setup 0x00

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. To scaffold, run:
   `npx create-expo-app@latest prodev-mobile-app-0x00`

2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

Running `npm run reset-project`:

- ❌ /app deleted.
- ❌ /components deleted.
- ❌ /hooks deleted.
- ❌ /constants deleted.
- ❌ /scripts deleted.

If you choose to move them to /app-example:

- 📁 /app-example directory created.
- ➡️ /app moved to /app-example/app.
- ➡️ /components moved to /app-example/components.
- ➡️ /hooks moved to /app-example/hooks.
- ➡️ /constants moved to /app-example/constants.
- ➡️ /scripts moved to /app-example/scripts.

In addition:

- 📁 New /app directory created.
- 📄 app/index.tsx created.
- 📄 app/\_layout.tsx created.

✅ Project reset complete. Next steps:

1. Run `npx expo start` to start a development server.
2. Edit app/index.tsx to edit the main screen.
3. Delete the /app-example directory when you're done referencing it.

## Get a fresh project

When you're ready, run:

```bash
npm run reset-project
```

This command will move the starter code to the **app-example** directory and create a blank **app** directory where you can start developing.
